This project is a Crime Detection System (Mini Project) designed as a simple web application for analyzing and detecting fraudulent or suspicious activities. 
It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, with multiple interactive pages for user interaction and visualization. 
The system includes features such as data handling, styled interfaces, and scripts that simulate or manage fraud detection processes. 
The project serves as a learning-oriented implementation, showcasing how front-end and back-end technologies can be integrated to address real-world issues like fraud detection in an accessible and educational way.
